Hi, I'm Jordan Klepper, Daily Show contributor, trump rally, press Pass, Holder, and, as of today, my most daring title yet podcast host. This is Jordan Klepper fingers. The Conspiracy, an all new limited podcast series brought to you by The Daily Show. Now, normally, when I hear Trump supporters bring up these let's just call them what they are, 100% unverified banana graham conspiracy theories, we grab, have the sound bite, pack it in the segment for The Daily Show, and move on to the next person. But now we're doing it differently. We're going way down the rabbit hole. What's on your back? Q. Flag. QAnon one of those crazy people like, did you know that Osama bin Laden is a guy named Tim? Is Bin Laden still alive? From the CIA? Yeah, we're doing a whole episode about that one. Is there anything you can tell us that I don't know? JFK Jr is still alive. What? JFK Jr coming back from the dead. That's an episode. Are they making pedophiles look cool? Well, if you go online, there's a whole list of pedophile symbols. Really? The deep state. That, too. Where do these conspiracy theories come from? You might think the Internet, and well, yeah, you're pretty much right. But where? On the internet. And how do they spread and metastasize? And how do we access those websites without getting a virus? That's a question for our It guy Dennis, who hasn't been in the office recently. I wonder why. The point is, I'm super excited, mostly terrified to unpack some of the wildest conspiracy theories I've ever heard, with experts who know all about them, journalists who come across this stuff every day, and even JFK Jr. Himself. Guys, can we get JFK Jr. One of the guys at Riley gave me a cell. I'll pass it on. So that's the deal. Jordan Klepper Fingers the Conspiracy, premiering November 9 eleven nine, which is the opposite of 911, which never happened.
